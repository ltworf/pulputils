Pulputils
=========

[THE PROJECT GOT MOVED](https://codeberg.org/ltworf/pulputils)

The idea behind the project is to group some commands that are often
useful on the shell, but complicated enough that scripting them in sh
would be error prone and time consuming.


This is the list of the current commands

* dedup: To find duplicate files and link or delete them
* fixnames: To rename files with names that require escaping into names that do not require escaping
* link2file: Replaces symlinks with a copy of the file
